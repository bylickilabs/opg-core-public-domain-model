## Power of Attorneys

A `PowerOfAttorney` is a legal document lodged by an individual with the Office of the Public Guardian stipulating, who,
in the case of the `Donor` losing capacity, may act upon the `Donor`s behalf. These actors are referred to as `Attorneys`.
A `PowerOfAttorney` can either be relating to the ``Health and Welfare`` or the ``Property and Financial Affairs`` of the `Donor`.
