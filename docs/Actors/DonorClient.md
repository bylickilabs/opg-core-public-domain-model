## Donors / Clients

The actor to whom the power of attorney or deputyship is acted upon is referred to as the donor or the client respectively.

A `Donor` is attached to a Power of Attorney and they have lodged the Power with the Office of the Public Guardian, whereas
when the court grants a `Deputyship` order it is the actor is now referred to as a `Client`. Ultimately they are very similar
however business approaches the Power of Attorney from a *case* centric view point and a Deputyship from a *client* centric viewpoint.
