## Deputyships

A `Deputyship` is granted when the `Client` loses capacity to either manage their finances or look after themselves and
will always supersede a `PowerOfAttorney` of the same type. When an `Order` is granted this is then acted upon by the
`Deputy` collection within the bounds prescribed by the court. A `Deputyship` can fall away if the `Client` regains the capacity to
perform their normal actions.
